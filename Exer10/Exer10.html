<h3><center><a href="https://lol.garena.ph/"> League of Legends </a>, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.</center></h3>

<p>League of Legends is the most popular video game and esport on the planet. It’s almost inconceivable that you or someone you know doesn’t know of at least one person who plays the game.

    To many, League of Legends is a confusing, chaotic game that seems to have a lot going on and too much information to process. Today, we’re here to give you a very basic overview of how you play the game, link you to some resources to learn more, and let you know what aspect of the game you might be interested in! It all starts with that simple question, though: what is League of Legends?</p>
<P>So you might be wondering what is league of legends, well League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the other’s base. Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.</P>
<p>"History", The idea of League of Legends emerged when the original developer of the Warcraft 3 mod Defence of the Ancients, or DOTA more commonly known by, Steve 'Guinsoo' Feak and the mods administrator of support base Steve 'Pendragon' Mescon met with the newly founded video game company Riot Games in 2005</p>
<p>League of Legends is a hard game to recommend for one reason: It is ridiculously complex. I've been playing for close to 700 hours and all I know is how little I know. Now, this can be a good thing because League of Legends is the kind of game you can play forever and still learn something new.</p>
